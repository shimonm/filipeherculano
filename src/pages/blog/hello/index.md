I am not sure yet why this blog exists, so far I have the following goals in mind:

- I want to organize my thoughts
- I want to get better at writting

My goals might change and this will be a living thing which will probably get updated with random content.

Feedback is always welcomed, the code for this blog is publicly available at [<u>github</u>](https://github.com/this-fifo/filipeherculano), feel free to open an issue there

Also, it's oficially winter now and I live in Canada at the moment, which means I was probably bored at home when I made this

Anyways, feel free to tag along
