### It's like snazzy but natty

I'm a big fan of the [iterm2-snazzy](https://github.com/sindresorhus/iterm2-snazzy) colours, but I never found a nice port to vscode that I could stick with in the long run so I decided to make my own

Natty has a darker background for higher contrast and doesn't make much use of red ‚Äî as I like to think red should be for errors ‚Äî I am still thinking of what else to customize but it's in good shape for general use already

### Here's some previews üé®

### Where next

Little details really bother me, so eventually I would like to have a much stronger level of customization and tweaks on things like punctuation, operators, language specific quirks and editor specific controls

I would also love to have this be a shared theme among many other development tools I use

I am open to contributions, suggestions, feedback and help. Feel free to check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/this-fifo/natty-theme) and the [vscode marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=this-fifo.natty)
